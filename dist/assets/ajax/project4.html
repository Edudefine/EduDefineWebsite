In real life, for a well-balanced world, and well-balanced organizations and teams, we need people who possess different mixtures of intelligences. The purpose of schooling "should be to find out the predominant skills and develop intelligences in students, to help them reach vocational and avocational goals that are appropriate to their particular spectrum of intelligences. In this way students feel more engaged and competent and therefore more inclined to serve society in a constructive way.<p>Multiple Intelligence Assessment is based on Howard Gardner’s theory of Multiple Intelligences. According to him humans have several different ways of processing information and these ways are relatively independent of one another. Gardner has identified nine intelligences: linguistic, logic-mathematical, musical, spatial-visual, bodily/kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, naturalistic and existential.<p><p>Here we are using Gardner’s multiple intelligences theory for their career development, selection of course activities, and related assessment strategies. We also provide instructions which are designed to help students develop their strengths. This can also trigger their confidence to develop areas in which they are not as strong. We are also addressing their multiple learning preferences by providing instructions which includes a range of meaningful and appropriate methods, activities, and assessments to improve the different intelligence areas that are needed to follow their passion. In summary, we integrate educational theories, teaching strategies, and other pedagogic tools in meaningful and useful ways to better address the needs of students.<p>Because we believe in what Gardner says as teachers should not follow one specific theory or educational innovation when designing instruction but instead employ customized goals and values appropriate to their teaching and student needs. Addressing the multiple intelligences and potential of students can help instructors personalize their instruction and methods of assessment.</div></div></div>
